# Rick And Morty

This web app consumes the [RickAndMortyAPI](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).
The app has the search function along with the pagination to better present Rick and Morty's characters.
The app uses an internal cache to prevent to perform too many REST calls.

## Ideas

For the episodes, we could cache each independent call or retrieve all episodes and then filter them and assign them to each character it was featured in.
The first option has been implemented.

## Angular-CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
